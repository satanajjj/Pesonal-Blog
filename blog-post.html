        <p>The positive side of juice cleansing is probably pretty obvious but 
            you're consuming plenty of fruits and vegetables, which we know should make up half of our plate.
            <blockquote cite="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/">"Studies have shown that fruit and vegetable juices can boost levels of important vitamins and antioxidants, 
              including folate, vitamin C, vitamin E and beta carotene"</blockquote> says Beaver. So, in theory, a juice cleanse is helpful 
            for people who find it hard to eat enough fruits and vegetables. But, as the old saying goes: 
            Too much of a good thing can be a bad thing.
            Juice cleansing comes with health risks
            In reality, juice cleansing isn't particularly healthy, and many juice cleansing 
            companies actually downplay the health risks of restricting your diet to just juice.</p>

        <p>There are major downsides to juice cleansing:

            the resulting nutrient deficiencies. Fruit and vegetable juice is almost completely devoid 
            of protein, healthful fats and certain vitamins (like B12) all of which are vital to health.
            Fiber is stripped out of fruits and vegetables during the juicing process. 
            Fiber is important for 'feeding' the healthy bacteria in our gut helping us feel full, 
            keeping blood sugar from going up too quickly and preventing constipation.
            It causes undesirable side effects. The low calorie content of most juices can elicit fatigue, 
            headaches, cravings and dizziness.
            It may lead to muscle and bone loss. Because juice contains limited amount of protein, your muscles 
            and bones can be affected.
